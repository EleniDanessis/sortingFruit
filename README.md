# Sorting Fruit

This project was made for educational purposes. I know it doesn't look like much but it could be applied as a simple component of a game. For example, maybe a character needs to sort items/rewards they have collected. 

Maybe the game is an educational one where an early learner needs to sort items/count by a certain, number, etc. If they completed this step correctly, then the items would be sorted out automatically.

This simple component could be scaled for data sorting, as well, similar to the Excel 
sort button.
